### Basic sensor response ratings
- Dynamic range
	- ratio between lower and upper limits
- Range = Dynamic range,
	- working range (usually lower limit - upper limit)
- Resolution
	- minimum difference b/w two values 
	- 보통 lower limit of dynamic range = resolution
- Linearity
	- variation of output signal as function of the input signal
- Bandwidth or Frequency
	- the speed at which a sensor can provide a stream of readings

### 실제 환경과 관련된 Characteristics
- Sensitivity
	- ratio of output change to input change
- Cross-sensitivity
	- sensitivity to environmental parameters that are orthogonal to the target parameters.
- Accuracy
	- $accuracy = 1-\frac{|m-v|}{v}$, 이 때 |m-v|가 error

- Systematic error → deterministic errors
- Random error → non-deterministic → described probabilistically
- Precision
	- reproducibility of sensor results 
	-
